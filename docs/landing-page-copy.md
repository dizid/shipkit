## 3. Problem Section

**Section heading:** Sound familiar?

**Intro line:**
You can ship code in your sleep. But launching? That's a different problem.

**Pain point 1 — Title:** You built it. Now what?
You've been heads-down for months. The app works. But you have zero users, zero revenue, and a nagging feeling that "just posting on Twitter" isn't a strategy.

**Pain point 2 — Title:** Too much noise, no signal.
You Googled "how to launch a SaaS" and found 47 conflicting guides, 12 YouTube tutorials, and a $500 course that promises to make you rich. None of them tell you what to actually do Monday morning.

**Pain point 3 — Title:** You're a developer, not a marketer.
Marketing feels like a foreign language. You know your product is good — but writing copy, finding the right tools, and figuring out what order to do things? That's not in the curriculum.

---

## 4. Solution / How It Works Section

**Section heading:** 32 tasks. 4 phases. One clear path.

**Intro sentence:**
ShipKit breaks the launch process into a sequential checklist. Each task tells you exactly what to do, why it matters, and which tool to use — no decisions left hanging.

---

- Set up your landing page and capture emails before you ship
- Define your positioning so your copy actually converts

## 5. Features Section

**Section heading:** Built for how developers actually work

---

**Feature 1 — AI-Personalized Copy**

Title: Copy that knows your product

Description: You answer a few questions about your app once. ShipKit uses that context to generate launch posts, Product Hunt descriptions, cold emails, and ad copy — all specific to what you built, not some generic SaaS template.

Example: Instead of "an AI tool that saves time", your Product Hunt tagline becomes "Shipkit — the 32-step launch checklist for developers with zero marketing background." That's the difference between ignored and upvoted.

---

**Feature 2 — Opinionated Tool Picks**

Title: One tool recommendation. Not twenty.

Description: Every task that requires a tool includes a single, specific recommendation — the one that works for solo founders at your stage. No comparison matrices, no affiliate rabbit holes, no decision fatigue.

Example: For email capture, we don't list 15 options. We say "use Loops" and tell you exactly how to set it up. You move on. That's it.

---

**Feature 3 — Step-by-Step Checklist**

Title: Not a course. Not a book. A checklist.

Description: Courses require motivation. Books require interpretation. A checklist just requires execution. ShipKit tells you what to do, in what order, with enough context to not get stuck — and nothing else.

Example: Task 7: "Submit to Indie Hackers". You get the exact post format, a prompt to generate your content, a screenshot of what a good post looks like, and a checkbox when you're done. That's the whole thing.

## 7. Comparison Section

**Section heading:** Why ShipKit instead of the alternatives?

**Comparison intro:**
There are other options. Here's the honest breakdown.

---

**vs ShipFast (or any boilerplate) — $99–$399**

ShipFast helps you build faster. ShipKit helps you launch. They solve different problems.

A boilerplate gives you auth, Stripe, and a landing page template. That's useful for building. But once you have an app and zero users, a boilerplate can't tell you how to get your first 100. ShipKit can.

ShipKit verdict: If you already have an app, ShipKit is what you need next. If you haven't built yet, build first — then come back.

---

**vs Courses and YouTube tutorials**

Courses teach. ShipKit executes.

Watching someone else's launch case study doesn't launch your app. Courses are passive — you watch, feel inspired, then close the tab and check Twitter. ShipKit is active — you complete a task, check a box, and move to the next one. The output is your launch, not your knowledge.

ShipKit verdict: Use courses to learn the "why." Use ShipKit to actually do the work.

---

**vs Figuring it out yourself**

You could build your own launch process from scratch. You'd spend 20 hours researching, make several wrong moves, and skip the things that actually matter because you don't know what you don't know.

ShipKit is a proven 32-step sequence distilled from real indie dev launches. The order matters. The tool picks matter. The templates matter. You're not reinventing the wheel — you're using one that already works.

ShipKit verdict: DIY is fine. ShipKit is faster.

---

## 8. FAQ Section

**Q: Is this another boilerplate or code template?**
A: No. ShipKit contains zero code. It's a launch strategy system — a checklist with tasks, instructions, templates, and AI copy generation. You bring the app. ShipKit handles the rest of what it takes to get from "built" to "paying customers."

**Q: What if I already launched?**
A: Skip Phase 1 and 2. Jump straight to Phase 3 (First 30 Days) or Phase 4 (Scaling). The tasks are sequential but not rigid — if you've already done something, check it off and move on. You'll still get value from the tasks you haven't done yet.

**Q: How is the AI different from just using ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT knows nothing about your app. ShipKit's AI uses the context you provide — your app name, target audience, problem it solves, unique angle — to generate copy that sounds like it was written specifically for you. The output is usable, not just a starting point you have to rewrite.

**Q: Can I use this for non-SaaS products?**
A: Yes. The checklist works for mobile apps, developer tools, open-source libraries, browser extensions, or any digital product you want people to actually pay for. The tasks are product-type agnostic. If it's software and it needs users, ShipKit applies.

**Q: What's actually in the free tier?**
A: Phase 1 — 5 tasks covering the foundation: landing page setup, email capture, social profile creation, analytics installation, and positioning. These are the tasks you need to do before anything else. It's a real, useful chunk — not a demo.

**Q: Do I need marketing or design skills?**
A: No marketing skills needed. Basic dev skills assumed — you should be comfortable deploying a site, adding a script tag, and following technical setup instructions. ShipKit is for developers, not growth hackers. The AI handles the copywriting.

**Q: What's the refund policy?**
A: 30 days, full refund, no questions asked. Email support@shipkit.dev with your purchase info and you'll get your money back. We'd rather you tell us what didn't work than have you feel stuck with something that wasn't right.

**Q: How long does the full checklist take to complete?**
A: Depends on your pace. Most developers finish Phase 1 in an afternoon. A focused launch week (Phase 2) takes 5–7 days if you're moving fast. The full 32 tasks, done properly, spans 6–8 weeks. You can go faster — but slower is usually better for getting real feedback at each stage.
